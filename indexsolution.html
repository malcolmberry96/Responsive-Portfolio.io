             <p> My name is Malcolm Berry and I am a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a bachelors degree in economics. My primary professional interest is web/software development, but I hope to one day break into the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. My interest in development started my junior year at UT where I took an introduction to probability and statistics course taught by the Computer Science department. I fell in love with the course, but most importantly sparked an interest in Computer Science. As I interacted with students and professors within the computer science department, I began to seek out ways in which I could turn my fascination into a possible career. Over the next year in college I began to slowly learn more and more about the field of computer science and decided to put my efforts, upon graduation, into becoming a developer.</p>
